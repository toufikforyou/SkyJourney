            <br />
            <p>
              From a Dream to the Skies – The Journey of SkyJourney In 2020,
              while the world was grounded, we were getting ready to take off.
              SkyJourney was founded during a time of global uncertainty, with
              one clear goal: to simplify and improve the way people book
              airline tickets. Where others saw a challenge, we saw an
              opportunity — to build a smarter, more customer-focused travel
              platform from the ground up.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Starting with a small, passionate team, we created a system that
              prioritized flexibility, transparency, and ease of use. We focused
              on what travelers truly needed: seamless booking experiences,
              reliable customer service, and fair, flexible options — especially
              when travel plans suddenly changed.

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              Over the years, we expanded our services — launching SkySaver for
              personalized deal alerts, introducing corporate and group
              bookings, and partnering with major airlines to bring better fares
              and more options to our users. Today, SkyJourney has helped over 2
              million travelers reach their destinations. But more than that,
              we've become part of countless personal stories — reunions, first
              adventures, business milestones, and dream vacations.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              At SkyJourney, we believe a ticket is more than just a seat — it’s
              the start of something meaningful. And we’re here to make sure
              that every journey begins smoothly, and ends with satisfaction.
